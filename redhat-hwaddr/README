A fact that will find all interfaces in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
and pull out the HWADDR from each.

You'd use this if you have bonded nics and need to know the real 
MAC addresses, since bonding will change the MAC on the network
cards at runtime.

    # facter -p|egrep '(hwad|mac)'
    hwaddr_eth0 => 00:14:5E:33:62:0A
    hwaddr_eth1 => 00:14:5E:33:62:0B
    macaddress => 00:14:5E:33:62:0A
    macaddress_bond0 => 00:14:5E:33:62:0A
    macaddress_bond0:1 => 00:14:5E:33:62:0A
    macaddress_eth0 => 00:14:5E:33:62:0A
    macaddress_eth1 => 00:14:5E:33:62:0A

This example shows that the standard macaddress_* facts do not cope
well with bonding, but this fact will add new facts that sets the 
real macs
